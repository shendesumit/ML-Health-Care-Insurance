# ML-Health-Care-Insurance
## Description
Insurance companies must set the insurance premiums following the population trends despite having limited information about the insured population if they have to put themselves in a position to make profits. This makes it necessary to estimate the average medical care expenses based on trends in the population segments, such as smokers, drivers, etc. You can use the Medical Cost Personal Datasets attached to this task to implement this regression project example. The aim here will be to predict the medical costs billed by health insurance to an individual given some or all of the independent variables of the dataset. Since the cost to be predicted is a continuous variable, it is pretty natural that regression is to be applied in its truest form (i.e., without the decision boundary as in regression-based classification). Therefore, you could choose to implement polynomial, multiple linear regression, or even Elastic Net Regression. Exploratory data analysis can be an essential step (even in this case despite the limited features). You will observe patterns, like the decreased tendency to smoke among those having children, helping you achieve reasonable feature selection and simpler models. 
## Pre-requisite: python, Scikit learn and pandas, matplotlib 
Train a linear regression model to predict the medical cost of the person.
